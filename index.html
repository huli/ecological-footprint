                    The ecological footprint measures the amount
                    of natural resources we use in one year.
                    <p />
                    If the demand we oppose to our nature exceeds the supply, 
                    the world will not be able to recover.

                    The further a country has developed, the higher the 
                    footprint most often is.
                    <p />
                    With a global footprint of 2.87 hectares are we using more 
                    than 50% of what our nature can regenerate.
                    The world currently has a biocapacity of 1.7 hectares
                    per capita.

                    Haiti and Burundi are doing very well for example.

                    Luxembourg has a footprint of enormous 13 hectares per capita
                    and is therefore using more than 21 times the natural ressources

                    Our global footprint is constantly growing while

                    <p/>
                    Between 1961 and the year 2013 the footprint has 
                    grown from 2.27 hectares (PC) to 2.87 while the 
                    biocapacity has shrunk from 3.12 to worrying 1.70

                    Cyprus has reduced its ressource consumption by
                    a third in the last years.

                    While Fiji has its footprint grown by frightening

                    That means, your country is one of the worlds
