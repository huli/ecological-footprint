                    The ecological footprint measures the amount
                    of natural resources we use in one year.
                    <p />
                    If the demand we oppose to our
                    nature exceeds the supply, the world will not be able to recover.
                    <p />
                    The resources of our planet are limited.

                    The more a country has progressed with what is normally 
                    referred to as human development, the higher the 
                    footprint most often is.
                    <p />
                    The world currently has a biocapacity of 1.7 hectares
                    per capita.

                    The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite statistic of average

                    being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living.

                    STORY MISSING <br/>
                    Haiti has a ecological footprint of 0.6 hectares per capita
                    and is therefore only using a third of the world populations
                    mean.
