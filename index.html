                    The ecological footprint measures the amount
                    of natural resources we use in one year.
                    <p />
                    If the demand we oppose to our nature exceeds the supply, 
                    the world sooner or later will not be able to recover.

                    <p/>
                    With a global footprint of 2.9 hectares we are using more 
                    than 1.5 times what our nature can regenerate.
                    The world currently has a biocapacity of 1.7 hectares

                    Haiti, Eritrea and Burundi are doing very well for example.

                    Haiti has a ecological footprint of 0.6 hectares per capita
                    and is therefore only using a third of the world populations

                    Luxembourg is the country with the highest footprint per

                    Luxembourg has a footprint of enormous 13 hectares per capita
                    and is therefore using more than 21 times the natural ressources

                    Our global footprint is constantly growing while
                    the biocapacity of our planet is decreasing.
                    <p/>
                    Between 1961 and the year 2013 the footprint has 
                    grown from 2.27 hectares (PC) to 2.9 while the 
                    biocapacity has shrunk from 3.1 to worrying 1.7

                    Cyprus has reduced its ressource consumption by

                    Timor-Leste, Djibouti and Fiji are the countries

                    While Fiji has its footprint grown by frightening
                    49 percent, the country today has still a smaller
