                    The ecological footprint measures the amount
                    of natural resources we use in one year.
                    <p />
                    If the demand we oppose to our nature exceeds the supply, 
                    the world sooner or later will not be able to recover.

                    Luxembourg has a footprint of enormous 13 hectares per capita

                    Between 1961 and the year 2013 the footprint has 
                    grown from 2.27 hectares (PC) to 2.9 while the 
                    biocapacity has shrunk from 3.1 to worrying 1.7
