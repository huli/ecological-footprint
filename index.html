                    The Ecological Footprint measures the demand on and
                    supply of nature.
                    <p />
                    The metric tracks our demand of six categories of productive surface areas: 
                    cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up land, forest area, 
                    and carbon demand on land.
                    <p />
                    If the demand is bigger than the supply. The world, sooner or later will not be able to recover.

                    The further a country has developed, the higher the 
                    footprint in most cases is. The development of a country
                    is measured with the Human development Index (see below).
                    <p/>
                    With a global footprint of 2.9 hectares we are using more 
                    than 1.5 times what our nature can regenerate.
                    The world currently has a biocapacity of 1.7 hectares
                    per capita - the biocapacity represents the productivity of its ecological 
                    assets.

                    Haiti, Eritrea and Burundi are at the bottom of the chart.
                    They are only using very little ressources and their footprints
                    are the smallest of all the countries.
                    <p/>
                    Haiti for example has only an ecological footprint of 0.6 hectares 
                    per capita and is therefore only using a third of the world populations
                    mean.

                    The countries at the top of the chart are using the most
                    ressources per capita. Luxembourg builds the very top,  
                    followed by Canada and Australia. 
                    <p/>
                    Luxembourg has a footprint of enormous 13 hectares per capita
                    and is therefore using more than 21 times the natural ressources
                    of Haiti.

                    Our global footprint is constantly growing while
                    the biocapacity of our planet is constantly decreasing.
                    <p/>
                    Between 1961 and the year 2013 the footprint has 
                    grown from 2.3 to 2.9 hectares (PC) while the 
                    biocapacity has shrunk from 3.1 to worrying 1.7

                    Cyprus, Greece and Barbados are the countries with
                    the best tendencies in recent years.
                    <p/>
                    While the footprint of Cyprus is still much higher
                    than in other countries. It has reduced the consumption
                    of ressources by a third since 2008.

                    Timor-Leste, Djibouti and Fiji are the countries
                    with the highest increaes in consumption.
                    <p/>
                    While Fiji has its footprint grown by frightening
                    49 percent, the country today has still a smaller
                    footprint that many others.
